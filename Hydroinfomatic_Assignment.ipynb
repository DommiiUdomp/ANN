    "### **Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Select an Indicator**\n",
    "- Choose one hydrological indicator from the list below, or propose your own (with approval):\n",
    "  - **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI):** Drought analysis.\n",
    "  - **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI):** Vegetation health.\n",
    "  - **Streamflow Anomaly:** Changes in streamflow patterns.\n",
    "  - **Flood Inundation Map:** Identifying flood-affected areas.\n",
    "  - **Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS):** Monitoring water availability.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Justify your choice:**  \n",
    "- Why is this indicator relevant for Thailand?  \n",
    "- What data sources and methods will you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Data Collection**\n",
    "- Use open-source datasets, such as:\n",
    "  - **ERA5-Land:** Climate variables like precipitation.\n",
    "  - **MODIS or Landsat:** NDVI or flood mapping.\n",
    "  - **GRACE:** Terrestrial water storage.  \n",
    "  - **Streamflow Data:** Available from local or international sources.\n",
    "- Explain your data source(s) and any preprocessing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Explain the Methodology**\n",
    "   - Describe how indicator is calculated:\n",
    "     - The time scale (e.g., monthly, seasonal, or annual).\n",
    "     - The classification criteria for indicator:\n",
    "   - Explain how data patterns are analyzed to complement Drought/Flood risk mapping.\n",
    "   - Mention spatial analysis techniques (e.g., clipping to specific regions, aggregating by provinces, or generating time-averaged maps).\n",
    "   - Identify regions with high SPI or heavy rainfall during specific periods.\n",
    "   - Note connections to flood events, river discharge data, or historical flooding records.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Computation**\n",
    "- Write a Python script to compute the chosen indicator. Use libraries like:\n",
    "  - **Xarray:** For handling multidimensional datasets.\n",
    "  - **Numpy/Pandas:** For numerical computation.\n",
    "  - **Google Earth Engine (GEE):** For open-source data access and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Visualization**\n",
    "- Create clear and insightful visualizations using maps, graphs, and tables to visualize results, such as:\n",
    "   - **Maps**: Spatial distribution maps or Interactive maps showing areas at risk.\n",
    "   - **Graphs**: Time-series plots for trend analysis for key locations or regions.\n",
    "   - **Tables**: SPI classifications by province.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Comparison with Open-Source Tools**\n",
    "- Compare your computed results with Google Earth Engine or other open-source platforms.\n",
    "- Reference results from similar studies (e.g., using Google Earth Engine or published risk maps).\n",
    "- Discuss the added value of your approach (e.g., higher spatial resolution, specific regional focus).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Application and Benefits**\n",
    "Write a short report answering the following:\n",
    "- How can this analysis benefit Thailand's water management, agriculture, or Thai organizations?\n",
    "- How could this be integrated into real-world decision-support systems?\n",
    "- What are the limitations of the chosen method?\n",
    "- Suggest areas for improvement, like integrating other indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Deliverables**\n",
    "1. **Findings**: Summarize the main findings and benefits\n",
    "2. **Code**: Submit a Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing your computations and visualizations.\n",
    "3. **Visualizations**: Provide clear graphs/maps and comparisons with open-source outputs.\n",
    "4. **Report**: Submit a 3-5 page document discussing the indicator selection, methods, results, and potential applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---"
